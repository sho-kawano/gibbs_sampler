# gibbs_sampler
These are exercises from Ch12 in the Probability & Statistics text by DeGroot & Schervish.  
I did this to learn the basics of MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo).
These are the sections I looked at:

* 12.2: Simulations (warm-up to MCMC)
* 12.5: Markov Chain Monte Carlo

I also did some pen & paper exercises as well but the learning from those don't necessarily transfer to being able to implement the sampler.

This turned out to be much harder than expected.  I love the DeGroot & Schervish text but, there are no code examples in the book or in the solutions.  Overall, I don't really recommend learning MCMC from this text.
There must be better references.
